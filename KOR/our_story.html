        <h1>Our Story</h1>
        <h3 class="paragraph">
            We started with an idea. We did not like it when a part on our bike wears down, because we can't ride until it's fixed, and now with supply chain issues it could take weeks to get a part. So we started developing this app to solve that issue. Jessica Wyman originally had this idea, She later reached out to Mason Tuft and Robert Tuft with this idea to develop an app for this issue, we started back in June of 2020. It has been a long journey, but we are here now!
