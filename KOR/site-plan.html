      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I love to mountain bike. I am a computer programer. I hate it when my bike breaks down due to a worn part. I developed an app to help you keep up on bike maintenance. I am planning on developing a website showcasing the mobile app. I hope to create a way for shops to join and share this app worldwide. This web application should help users understand the purpose of this app and get the chance to join in.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The audience will be mountain bike shops that are looking to showcase my mobile app at their shop. Another audience would probably be mountain bikers that are interested in what this mobile app is all about. The larger amount of the audience would probably be those that are really interested in maintaining their components on their bike.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h3>Our Story</h3>
      <p>
        We started with an idea. We did not like it when a part on our bike wears down, because we can't ride until it's fixed, and now with supply chain issues it could take weeks to get a part. So we started developing this app to solve that issue.
